            <h2>Work &amp; Volunteer Experience</h2>
            <p>I joined Microsoft Corporation in 2013 as a Software Engineer. I worked on the Microsoft Certification Programs to get the designation of Microsoft Certified Professional. In 2015, I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer and in 2017, to Architect. I have expertise in the development of software products throughout their lifecycle defining requirements to successfully launching them. By encouraging the software engineering team to adopt the latest standards for software application development and tools, I introduced best practices to improve product requirements and customize the software for end users. Volunteering has been an important part of my life. While studying, I volunteered with TELUS Wise, a program to help youngsters speak up when they see cyberbullying as well as educate seniors on being safe when using the internet. Now in Redmond, I have joined the Seattle Java Users Group to help me network with professionals in my field and keep up to date with developments. I also volunteer with OneAmerica, a group that mentors immigrant students helping them with digital literacy and spoken English.</p>
