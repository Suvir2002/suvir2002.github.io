        <li>Intel introduces the first microprocessor (Intel 4004)</li>
        <p class="liattach">The Intel 4004 was one of the first microprocessors ever produced, released in 1971. The 4004 was designed by Federico Faggin, Masatoshi Shima and others. It had a maximum clock speed of 740 kHz and could do up to 92600 instructions per second. It was also in production for 10 years (1971-1981). On top of all this it has 2300 transistors.</p>

        <li>IBM 3850 mass storage system was introduced</li>
        <p class="liattach">The IBM 3850 Mass Storage System was an online tape library used to hold large amounts of infrequently accessed data. It was one of the earliest examples of nearline storage.</p>


        <li>Japanese Manufactured Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM)</li>
        <p class="liattach">The Japanese Trade Ministry saw a chance to make Japan a leader in the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip industry, as sales soared when DRAMs entered commercial production in the early 1970s. With customer demand in the millions, DRAMs became the first “mass market” chips, sparking fierce international competition. In 1976, the Japanese Trade Ministry funded Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, NEC, and Toshiba to develop 64K DRAMs. This provoked the U.S. government to threaten trade sanctions.</p>

        <li>Steve Wozniak completes the Apple 1 and its successor Apple 2 is introduced the following year</li>
        <p class="liattach">Designed by Sunnyvale, California native Steve Wozniak, and marketed by his friend Steve Jobs, the Apple-1 was a single-board computer for hobbyists. With an order for 50 assembled systems from Mountain View, California computer store The Byte Shop in hand, the pair started a new company, naming it Apple Computer, Inc. Around 200 of the boards were sold before Apple announced the successor the Apple 2 a year later as a ready to use computer for consumers. The new model sold in the millions for nearly two decades.</p>

        <li>Motorola Introduces The 68000 Microprocessor</li>
        <p class="liattach">The Motorola 68000 microprocessor delivered a processing speed far greater than its competition. This high performance processor found its place in powerful work stations intended for graphics-intensive programs common in engineering. Later it is chosen as the processor for the Apple Macintosh and Amiga computers.</p>
