        <li>Intel Announces The Commercialisation of 3D Transistors</li>
        <p class="liattach">Intel's 22nm 3D transistors provide up to a 37 percent performance increase at low voltage versus Intel's 32nm planar transistors. This means that the transistors are ideal for use in small handheld devices, which operate using less energy to 'switch' back and forth.</p>

        <li>NVMe SSDs Are Released</li>
        <p class="liattach"> NVMe is a communications interface/protocol developed specially for SSDs by a number of vendors including Intel, Samsung, Sandisk, Dell, and Seagate. NVMe is designed to take advantage of the unique properties of pipeline-rich, random access, memory-based storage. There is also very low latency. Today's NVMe based drives have throughputs up to 16 gigabytes per second. Vendors are pushing for 32 GBps or higher, the max throughput on a 3rd generation sata interface is 6 gigabytes per second.</p>

        <li>High Bandwith Memory (HBM) is Released</li>
        <p class="liattach">High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a high-performance RAM interface for 3D stacked DRAM from AMD and Hynix. It is in high-performance graphics cards and network devices. The first devices to use HBM are the AMD Fiji GPUs. It allows for a memory bus to have a higher width due to it being a stack of 4 DRAM dies. It has two 128-bit channels per die for a total of 8 channels and a width of 1024 bits. If you stack 4 of them you will have memory bus width of 4096 bits. There is also a better power efficecy with HBM compared to GDDR5.</p>

        <li>Raspberry Pi is Released</li>
        <p class="liattach">It is credit card sized computer that features ease of use and simplicity making it highly popular with students and hobbyists. In October 2013, the one millionth Raspberry Pi was shipped. Only one month later, another one million Raspberry Piâ€™s were delivered. The Pi weighed 45 grams and sold for only $25-$35 U.S. Dollars. The Raspberry Pi runs on Raspbian OS which is based on Debian (a Linux Distrobution).</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PnkATI5.jpg" class="imgli" width="180" height="150">
        <li>The Apple iPad is Released</li>
        <p class="liattach">The iPad has many of the popular capabilities of the iPhone, such as built-in high-definition camera, access to the iTunes Store, and audio-video capabilities. But it has a nine inch screen. Apps, games, and accessories helped increase the popularity of the iPad and led it to its adoption in thousands of different applications from movie making, creating art, making music, inventory control and point-of-sale systems.</p>
