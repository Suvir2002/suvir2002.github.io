        <li>Linus Torvalds Releases The Linux Kernel</li>
        <p class="liattach">Linus Torvalds a Finnish university student designs and releases the Linux kernel to several Usenet newsgroups. Almost immediately, enthusiasts began developing and improving it, such as adding support for peripherals and improving its stability. Today the Linux kernel is used for a number of things. It is used in different distributions of the Linux operating system, running servers and it is even on some of our phones (Android relies on Linux for core system services such as security, memory management, process management, network stack, and driver model.)</p>

        <li>SSD Module Made For Evaluation by IBM</li>
        <p class="liattach">A prototype solid state disk module was made for evaluation by IBM. SanDisk, which at time was known as SunDisk, manufactured the module which used non-volatile (won’t be cleared on power loss) memory chips to replace the spinning disks of a hard disk drive. SanDisk recognized that handheld devices and computers were becoming lighter and smaller, and that flash memory, offered powerful advantages over hard disks.</p>

        <li>Java 1.0 is Introduced</li>
        <p class="liattach">Java 1.0 is introduced by Sun Microsystems. The Java platform’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” functionality let a program run on any system, offering users independence from traditional large software vendors like Microsoft or Apple.</p>

        <li>The "WordWideWeb" is Born</li>
        <p class="liattach">At the world’s biggest physics laboratory, CERN in Switzerland, English programmer and physicist Tim Berners-Lee submited two proposals for what would become the Web, starting in March of 1989. Neither of his proposals were approved. He then proceeded anyways, with only unofficial support from his boss and his coworker Robert Cailliau. By Christmas of 1990 he has prototyped “WorldWideWeb”. It featured a server, HTML, URLs, and the first browser.</p>

        <li>Compact Flash is Introduced</li>
        <p class="liattach">CompactFlash was introduced by SanDisk, it was quickly adopted and becomes the preferred memory storage option in many consumer as well as professional electronic devices. It was highly popular in video cameras and although its dimensions were slightly larger than some other memory card formats, its ruggedness and high capacity made it the preferred choice.</p>

        <li>All-In-One Macitosh Desktop Computers Are Released</li>
        <p class="liattach">Apple’s iMac, sold for about $1,300. Customers got a machine with a 233-MHz G3 processor, 4GB hard drive, 32MB of RAM, a CD-ROM drive, and a 15" monitor. The machine was noted for its ease-of-use and included a 'manual' that contained only a few pictures and less than 20 words.</p>

        <li>Nvidia Releases the GeForce 256</li>
        <p class="liattach">Based on a processor this was specially designed to manipulate graphics, the GeForce 256 was often thought of as the first consumer GPU, and while expensive, it sold extremely well. The GeForce 256 was designed to relieve the pressure on the central processing unit (CPU) by handling graphics calculations, while the CPU processed non-graphics intensive tasks.</p>
