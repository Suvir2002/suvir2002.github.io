            <ul>

                <li class="lia">Always Use Boilerplate Code</li>
                <p class="lipara">Boilerplate code is the miniumum code required for a website. Without it your website won't work.</p>
                
                <li class="lia">Always Indent Your Code</li>
                <p class="lipara">Indenting your code makes your workspace cleaner. You will be able to find the neccessary code faster and indenting will make your code look more professional.</p>
                            
                <li class="lia">Dont Be Afraid To Fail</li>
                <p class="lipara">When learning code, play around with it. Doing this you can learn new tricks and concepts you can add to your websites you make later.</p>
                
                <li class="lia">Find The Right IDE For Yourself</li>
                <p class="lipara">Your IDE is one of your primary tools when coding. There are thousands of IDE you can find online, many have a different feel and looks. Go through them and see what you work best with.</p>

                <li class="lia">Ask For Help</li>
                <p class="lipara">You learn faster with mentors and listening to peer feedback. What may seem like an immovable bug or an unlearnable topic could be quickly alleviated by a fresh pair of eyes or a new interpretation of the subject. So when you have code that isn't working as you planned, ask for help.</p>
                
                <li class="lia">Understand The Fundamentals</li>
                <p class="lipara">Programming fundamentals always need to come first. The better you understand the fundamentals, the easier it is to learn advanced concepts.</p>
