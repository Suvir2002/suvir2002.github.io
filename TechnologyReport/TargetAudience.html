            <p>The Huawei P20 Pro is competing with the devices in the high-end flagship zone. They are competing with devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the iPhone X. The phone is targeted to users who are tech savvy, price conscious as well as like taking photographs. The phone has amazing specs for the price. It offers more features than the Samsung S9 and iPhone X while being very competitively priced at CAD $1155. For example, the Leica zoom lens can achieve 5X Hybrid Zoom to capture incredible detail at a distance as well as AI image stabilization that allows users to take blur free pictures. Due to the Huawei P20 Pro having a very fast octa core processor, 6GB of RAM and a 4000mAh battery it is also targeted to heavy duty users who like to multitask and have enough power to last them the entire day.</p>
