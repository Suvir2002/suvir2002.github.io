            <h2>NBA Star Wins Oscar</h2>
            <p>At Sunday night's 90th annual Academy Awards, retired NBA star Kobe Bryant wins Oscar for his short animated film "Dear Basketball". After winning the Oscar Kobe said, "I don't know if it's possible," Bryant retorted. "I mean, as basketball players, we are really supposed to shut up and dribble. But I am glad we do a little bit more than that."</p>

            <h2>J.R. Smith Throws Soup</h2>
            <p>Clevland Cavalviers shooting guard J.R. Smith suspended 1 day by the organization for throwing soup at coaching staff. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Smith did not address the team over the latest drama for a team that has had no shortage of theatre this season. The 32-year-old Smith, who served his suspension while the Cavs were beaten by the Sixers, had a history of fines and other issues before arriving in Cleveland by a trade in 2015. However, heâ€™s had few problems with the Cavs and has been a key member of three straight Eastern Conference championships. </p>

            <h2>Getting Rid of One-And-Done</h2>
            <p>In the wake of the pay-for-play scandal rocking college basketball and the NCAA, Adam Silver and the NBA are considering removing the 'one-and-done' age limit rule for players who want to enter the NBA draft among other strategies to get more involved with youth basketball on a global scale. We are not sure when or even if this will but it is likely it will.</p>
