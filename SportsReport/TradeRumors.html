                <h2>Enes Kanter Leaving Knicks For Free Agency?</h2>
                <p>Enes Kanter has become a fan favorite at Madison Square Garden, but the Knicks big man might not be long for New York. With a player option for the 2018-19 season, Kanter's immediate future is in question.
                After the season, Kanter will have two options to choose from thanks to a contract he signed before coming to New York: Opt-in for next season at an $18.6M salary or test free agency this summer. With the NBA salary cap leveling out and failing to rise at the rate that was once anticipated when Kanter signed his deal, it's hard to imagine the 25-year-old earning more per season on a new deal. But there's little doubt Kanter could earn another long-term deal for more total money.

                <h2>Lebron To LA?</h2>
                <p>When the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland Cavaliers agreed a trade on deadline day last month, it was obvious that the former was taking a punt on the future, while the other sought immediate rewards. As far as the Lakers are concerned, acquiring Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and the Cavs’ first round pick in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. might have a limited-short term impact, but the long-term consequences could be momentous for both teams and for the NBA as a whole. The Lakers can now clear out salary space for two max-level contracts and have given themselves a shot to sign LeBron James this summer. However, it is not only the Lakers’ financial flexibility that makes them such an attractive destination for James. Speaking on Monday night, Fox Sports’ Colin Cowherd suggested Lonzo Ball’s development could prove just as crucial in luring the four-time MVP to California. </p>

                <h2>Aaron Gordon To The Suns?</h2>
                <p>In the midst of a career year, Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon could be poised to make some noise on the upcoming restricted free agent market. According to Sean Deveney of Sporting News, Gordon, 24, is expected to draw interest this summer from the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Indiana Pacers. League sources told Sporting News this week that the Suns are expected to be suitors for Gordon, who starred at Arizona for one memorable season. Phoenix has ample cap room and a roster in need of more proven players. Another team with interest in Gordon, according to sources, would be the rebuilding Mavericks, who have been eager to find a budding star to fill in alongside Harrison Barnes and Dennis Smith Jr., softening the blow of Dirk Nowitzki's retirement, which could come in just months. The Pacers intend to investigate restricted free agents, too, hoping to add young talent to an improving roster. Still, if any team makes a formal offer, the Magic can match it.</p>
